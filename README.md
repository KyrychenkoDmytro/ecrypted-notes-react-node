EncryptedNotes is an encrypted messaging application.
Routing is done with React Router Dom in SPA style.
The layout of the site was made using the React library using the Bootstrap CSS framework.
Backend - Node.js interacts with the MySQL database through the sequelize module.
The database is located on a third-party Open Server service, without which the application will not work.
Go to backend folder(cd backend). Run "npm i" and after run "node index.js".
Open second console and run "npm i" after run "npm start"
If the open server is running in my computer - enjoy the work.
