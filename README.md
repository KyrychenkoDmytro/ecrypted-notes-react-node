EncryptedNotes is an encrypted messaging application.
Routing is done with React Router Dom in SPA style.
The layout of the site was made using the React library using the Bootstrap CSS framework.
Backend - Node.js interacts with the MySQL database through the sequelize module.
The database is located on a third-party Open Server service, without which the application will not work.
Run backend "npm run backend".
After you run React "npm start" and if the open server is running - enjoy the work.
